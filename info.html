			<h2>History of Game Name</h2>
			<p>The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made.[4] He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robbins later sold the rights to Uno to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market Uno, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois.

				In 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies.</p>

			<h2>How to Play Uno Game</h2>
			<p>Cards are played by laying them face-up on top of the discard pile. Play initially proceeds clockwise around the table. A player who draws a playable card from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no other card from their hand on that turn.
				A player may play a Wild card at any time, even if that player has other playable cards.
				A player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color. The player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card.[6] A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence (see Penalties) to prove that their hand meets this condition.
				If not otherwise challenged, an illegally played Wild Draw Four stays without penalty for its player.

				When playing a Wild or Wild Draw Four card, a player may declare the current color as the next one to be matched.
				If the draw deck runs out during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. Play then proceeds normally.
				It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player.
				A player who plays their penultimate card must call "Uno" as a warning to the other players.[7]
				
				The first player to get rid of their last card ("going out") wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players. Number cards count their face value, all action cards count 20, and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards count 50. If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out, the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied.
				
				The first player to score 500 points wins the game.</p>
